            <h3>WHY DRIP CAMPAIGNS?</h3>

            <p>Drip e-mail campaigns are part of marketing automation tools.</p>

            <p>Campaign usually consists of series of emails which are scheduled with aim to move
                customer down the sales funnel. The main goal is to build build relationship
                gradually and not trying to put every piece of content in one hard sales email..
                Because campaign consists of set of emails it is possible to adapt content on the
                way. For example based on customer click history or purchase behaviour.</p>

            <p>As a result customers have personalised experience and store owners have boosted
                revenue and increased customer loyalty!</p>
